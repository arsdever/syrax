# Syrax editor
### Qt version [`5.11.2`](https://download.qt.io/official_releases/qt/5.11/5.11.2/)
Syrax editor is a new text editor, which allows you to easly contribute many plugins. It's written in `C++` programming language using [Qt](www.qt.io/) library.

To contribute new plugins, you have to build final `.dll` and add path to it in file `plugin_list.json`, which have to be in the same directory as main program is.

You can download the latest release [here](https://github.com/arsdever/syrax/releases)

> Please open visual studio using [`open_debug.bat`](open_debug.bat) or [`open_release.bat`](open_release.bat), because there are some configurations included.

I'm happy to hear any feedback from you. 

## Thank you
