# Syrax editor
Syrax editor is a new text editor, which allows you to easly contribute many plugins. It's written in `C++` programming language using `QT` library.

To contribute new plugins, you have to build final `.dll` and add path to it in file `plugin_list.json`, which have to be in the same directory as main program is.

You can download the latest release (beta versions) from [`build repository`](builds/) or latest stable release from [`stable build repository`](builds/stable/)

> Please open visual studio using [`open_debug.bat`](open_debug.bat) or [`open_release.bat`](open_release.bat), because there are some configurations included.

I'm happy to hear any feedback from you. 

## Thank you
